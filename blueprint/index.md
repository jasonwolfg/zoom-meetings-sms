This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint describes how agents can schedule meetings with customers using Zoom and Genesys Cloud. Genesys Cloud sends an SMS message to the customer with a meeting URL and opens Zoom for the agent. Calls in a queue can be inbound or outbound as long as they are in a queue.

The following illustration shows the meeting scheduling solution from an agent's perspective.

![Zoom agent view](images/zoom-workflow.png "Meeting scheduling solution using Zoom from an agent's point of view")

The following is an example of the end-to-end experience customers and agents can expect from this blueprint.

![Overview](images/ZoomVideoSMSBlueprint.gif "Overview")

You can enable an agent to create a Zoom meeting from their Genesys Cloud agent UI. This is done by using Genesys Cloud and Zoom public APIs. The following illustration shows the Genesys Cloud and Zoom API calls.

![Zoom integration](images/zoom-architect.png "The API calls between Genesys Cloud and Zoom API")

## Solution components

* **Genesys Cloud** - A suite of Genesys cloud services for enterprise-grade communications, collaboration, and contact center management. Contact center agents use the Genesys Cloud user interface.
* **Genesys Cloud API** - A set of RESTful APIs that enable you to extend and customize your Genesys Cloud environment. This solution uses the API to send meeting information to the caller as an agentless outbound SMS notification.
* **Amazon Web Services** - Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cloud computing platform that provides a variety of cloud services such as computing power, database storage, and content delivery. AWS hosts Genesys Cloud.
* **Zoom** - A virtual meeting and collaboration app. Zoom is the app that hosts the meeting for our solution.
